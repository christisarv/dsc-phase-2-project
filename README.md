# Housing Data Analysis


## Overview

For this project I'll be using the Kings County housing dataset to solve a housing-related business problem using linear regression techniques. I'll be using the CRISP-DM Data Science method which the structure this notebook will follow, demonstraing an iterative modeling process with feature engineering, model fit, evaluation, and repeating until the model proves to be useful to my business case.

### The Data

This data includes house sale prices and conditions from houses sold through 2014-2015 in the Seattle area. These houses were built as early as 1900 and as late as 2015. The data includes several variables that describe the house, its location, and its condition. 

### Business Problem

The stakeholder for this project, a housing development company, working on new model homes, wants to design houses that will sell to middle class buyers who are currently facing a shortage of available and affordable inventory due to the increase in demand during 2020.

The median national home listing price grew by 13.4% over last year nationally, and The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area saw YoY listing prices rise 7.8% with a median price of $627,500. Meanwhile, there was a 35.6% decrease in listings. So less houses available and higher prices.

The developers would like understand which features a home should include at the median price range so that they can appropriately design new homes to replenish inventory and make some sales where they know demand exists.

## Methods



## Results

* **Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process.** Refer to [the Data Science Process lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-processes) from Topic 19 for more information about process models you can use.

* **Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

* **Based on the results of your models, your notebook and presentation should discuss at least two features that have strong relationships with housing prices.**

### Conclusions



## Next Steps

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
